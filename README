Linux and Unix System Helper (LUSH)
-----------------------------------

LUSH takes care of updating your package manager repository, checking if updates are available and
sending you a mail in case a system needs updating. You can also run rootkit detectors and get
informed when something is not normal. LUSH also helps you to keep track of your updates by keeping
a log of your updates and who did them.
